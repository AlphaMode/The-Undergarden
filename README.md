# Deep underground, a forgotten land awaits.
This mod adds a whole new dimension to Minecraft **1.15.2**.

## What is the Undergarden?
The Undergarden is a dark, subterranean world located deep below the bedrock of the Overworld. The flora here has adapted to their conditions and can grow anywhere, independent of light.

The only source of natural light is provided by some of the strange flora that call the Undergarden home. 

## Features
- A whole new dimension to explore, build, and survive in
- 3 music tracks created by my friend **Screem** that only play in the Undergarden
- Unique ores, each with their own benefits and weaknesses
