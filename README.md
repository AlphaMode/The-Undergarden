# Deep underground, a forgotten land awaits.
This mod adds a whole new dimension to Minecraft **1.15.2**.

## What is the Undergarden?
The Undergarden is a dark, subterranean world located deep below the bedrock of the Overworld. The flora here has adapted to their conditions and can grow anywhere, independent of light. Strange creatures call these dark lands home, and are plagued by the invasive Rotspawn, originating from a chaotic, mysterious realm.

## Features
- A whole new dimension to explore, build, and survive in
- 4 music tracks created by my friend **Screem** that only play in the Undergarden
- Unique ores, each with their own benefits and weaknesses
- A handful of new advancements, with more to come
